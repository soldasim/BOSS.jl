    TuringBI(; kwargs...)

Samples the model parameters and hyperparameters using the Turing.jl package.

To use this model fitter, first add the Turing.jl package.

## Keywords
- `sampler::Any`: The sampling algorithm used to draw the samples.
- `warmup::Int`: The amount of initial unused 'warmup' samples in each chain.
- `samples_in_chain::Int`: The amount of samples used from each chain.
- `chain_count::Int`: The amount of independent chains sampled.
- `leap_size`: Every `leap_size`-th sample is used from each chain. (To avoid correlated samples.)
- `parallel`: If `parallel=true` then the chains are sampled in parallel.

## Sampling Process

In each sampled chain;
  - The first `warmup` samples are discarded.
  - From the following `leap_size * samples_in_chain` samples each `leap_size`-th is kept.
Then the samples from all chains are concatenated and returned.

Total drawn samples:    'chain_count * (warmup + leap_size * samples_in_chain)'
Total returned samples: 'chain_count * samples_in_chain'
